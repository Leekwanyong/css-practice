                            I started as a frontend developer in college, and later I co-founded Aroliant Internet
                            Private Limited with a friend. As a director and a developer, I learned a lot about managing
                            a company, team, and projects.

                            And in two years, I found my passion for design. In 2020 for personal reasons, I became a
                            freelancer. Now, I‚Äôm selling digital goods on the web and working on freelance projects. I
                            love helping small businesses to create their online presence.

                            My design work ensures that it is developer-friendly as it passes through the lens of my
                            experience as a frontend developer. When I design, I make sure it is 100% implementable by a
                            frontend developer without any difficulties. I call it ‚ÄúDesign for Code.‚Äù
